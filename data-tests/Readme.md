# Mapping Test Cases  

The mapping test cases are used to determine the coverage of the OWL-to-OAS mapping of tools that implements it. All test are compliant to the example ontology that has been generated to show how to translate a OWL ontology to OAS.

In each folder you can find different tests including the following files:

- A description of the test.
- The CSV data source.
- The RDF corresponding to the annotated data source.  
- The Rules with the declarative YARRRML rules for the RDF generation.
- The Mapping with the resulting translation.
